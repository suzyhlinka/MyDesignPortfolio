# MyDesignPortfolio
It's only the beginning

I'm not the best with Git, but this is a way for me to document my portfolio from now until whenever.
I want to keep it simple. In every way possible. 
I want to learn and develop from what I had before. And benefit from this in the longrun.

Everything's a process. And the designer's portfolio is a big one.
